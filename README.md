**Compiled Executables for the Raspberry Pi**

This repository contains **mbaigo systems** that have been cross-compiled for the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi was selected as the platform because it effectively demonstrates the potential of edge computing. Additionally, using a Raspberry Pi enhances security by isolating the system from personal computers. This reduces the risk of exposing sensitive data, prevents unauthorized access to personal files or applications, and limits the impact of potential vulnerabilities by confining operations to a dedicated, purpose-built device. The Raspberry Pi's small footprint and customizable environment further contribute to a secure and controlled deployment setup.
